# Lab316.2.1

This is a simple guessing game created using Javascript.
It prompts the end user to guess which cookie jar is hiding
the cookie. Currently, the max number of guesses and the 
number of cookie jars is hardcoded. 

If the guess is incorrect, it will tell the user to guess
higher or lower than the current guess. If the guess is correct,
the program returns an alert that the cooke has been found.

### Pending updates:

* Each incorrect guess will tell the user how many guesses they have 
left

* Each incorrect guess will remove the cookie jar in the position of
  guessed value

* Correct guess will remove all images and return an image of a cookie
  in the possition of the correct jar

* An alert will be added if the number of guesses have been
  exhausted and the correct answer has not been found (user did
  not win the game)
